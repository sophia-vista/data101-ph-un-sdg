However, recent estimations indicate that due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global poverty rate experienced a significant rise from 8.3 percent in 2019 to 9.2 percent in 2020. This increase marks the first instance of extreme poverty escalating since 1998 and represents the largest setback to poverty reduction since 1990. As a result, progress in reducing poverty has been pushed back by approximately three years. Currently, the projected poverty rate of the Philippines by 2030 is 7%%, which fails to achieve the goal of this SDG.",
